# Thryve - Backend API

Thryve is a real-time, community-driven support platform designed to empower individuals
navigating chronic illnesses like Type 1 Diabetes, Thalassemia, and more. This backend
API powers all core functionalities of the Thryve platform from user authentication and
role-based access to post sharing, encrypted chats, anonymous identity handling, and
doctor consultations.

- Express.js
- PostgreSQL (via Neon)
- Prisma ORM
- JWT for Authentication
- WebSockets (planned for real-time chat)
- Stripe (for mentor/doctor consultations)
- Cloudinary (for media uploads)
